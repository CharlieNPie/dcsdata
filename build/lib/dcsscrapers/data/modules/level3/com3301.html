          <td>This module is an  introduction to the processes involved in working with real customers and  solving business problems, using agile practices. Students work in teams to  develop an effective landing page and marketing strategy, supported by staff  from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.epigenesys.org.uk/">epiGenesys</a>. In a marketing context a landing page is a web page  (or a small website) designed for a single objective; in this module the  purpose is to inform and persuade customers of the benefits of a commercial  software product. The landing page will form a key component of a marketing  strategy that has the goal of increasing sales of the product.</td>

          <th>Teaching Method</th>
          <td>During the year students will work in teams to create an effective landing page and marketing strategy. In the first 7 weeks of each semester training will be provided in a flipped classroom style. Students will study material in the online learning environment and attend training sessions, whilst also working on their team project. For the remainder of each semester students will continue to work on their project. Students are expected to be proactive in developing their knowledge and skills, using the training as a foundation and seeking guidance from their mentor as needed.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th>Feedback</th>
          <td><p>Students will meet weekly as a team with their mentor to discuss their progress and plans. The mentor will offer feedback and guidance, and encourage the students to be proactive in developing their knowledge and skills in appropriate areas. Students will be required to provide draft submissions for elements of their team project throughout the semester so that mentors are able to review these.<br>
            <br>
            Students will hold regular retrospectives as a team where they will review their own practices and identify opportunities for improvement. Mentors will facilitate and/or observe these retrospectives as needed to ensure they are effective, and offer feedback and guidance to students on their facilitation of and participation in retrospectives.<br>
            <br>
            At the end of each breadth of knowledge test a score will be provided in the online learning environment. Following this, explanatory comments will be emailed for the questions that are most frequently answered incorrectly by the cohort.<br>
            <br>
          Following the end of each semester, students will be emailed both team and individual marks and feedback sheets. These will include marks and explanatory comments for appropriate activities as described in the module mark scheme. Much of the feedback and guidance provided will relate to the performance of the team (which accounts for 80% of the assessment) rather than the individual. However, individual feedback and guidance will also be provided where issues are highlighted in peer reviews or where mentors have specific observations.</p></td>
