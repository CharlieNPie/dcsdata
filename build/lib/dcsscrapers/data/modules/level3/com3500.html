          <td> In the individual research project, you will complete a major original piece of software design, experimental investigation or theoretical proof. This work will be reported formally in a research dissertation and also presented at a poster session, to which industrial representatives, students and academics are invited. The work will include an Interim report that consists of an initial survey and literature review. You will be engaged in a major piece of software development, or the design and execution of an empirical experiment, or the elaboration and practical verification of a theory. You will have regular meetings with your supervisor, who will advise on any problems you encounter. You will prepare a dissertation of between 6000-12000 words in length, which includes the material from the interim report, but also contains a complete design, implementation and evaluation of the results of your project. This may be assessed by oral examination. </td>

                presentation and question handling;</li>
              <li>give the student the further opportunity to
