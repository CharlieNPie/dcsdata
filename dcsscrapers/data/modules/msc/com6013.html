University. The project is completed during the summer, and each student will have a personal academic supervisor to guide them during this period.
The individual project is examined by a dissertation based on the project work and an oral examination.
This module has been designed for students taking the MSc Cybersecurity and AI programme. The topic will be at the interface of Cybersecurity and
AI. This provides a significant element of "glue" bringing together the two areas that make up the programmes.</td>

            <ul>
              <li>LO1 research the background to a challenging research problem at the interface of cybersecurity and artificial intelligence. Specifically:
a) survey relevant literature and comment critically on it
b) identify/confirm an original and challenging research question (or questions) to be addressed and appreciate the feasibility of doing so
within the time available on the project; </li>
              <li> LO2 plan, monitor and possibly re-plan work according to progress made;</li>
              <li>LO3 identify what needs to be done to answer the research question(s), and to identify appropriate approaches and techniques to be used to
develop the solution (i.e. identify an appropriate methodology). This is solution 'synthesis'. It includes developing understanding of the capabilities of available resources (such as tools and techniques) and
whether they suffice to underpin a solution as well as the identification of a specific solution path. Note: methodology must take into
account ethics and other contextual considerations.  </li>
              <li>LO4 demonstrate competence in using appropriate solution tools;  </li>
              <li>LO5 evaluate work done in an appropriately rigorous manner and use the results to draw appropriate conclusions or inform further work.
This will include, for example, identification of evaluation criteria, testing or analysis of artefacts developed (e.g. software), demonstration of
reasonable experimental practices, critical review of assumptions made, appreciation of threats to validity, drawing evidenced conclusions, and identification of future work; </li>
<li> LO6 demonstrate an appreciation of the professional, social, ethical, legal and other contextual considerations that apply to the work they
have done. Note the area of Cybersecurity and AI is at the confluence of two topics that raise interesting contextual issues in their own
right. The MSc in predominantly 'technical' in nature but we do require an appreciation of wider issues; </li>
<li>LO7 to document work carried out in a form suitable for a technically able but not necessarily specialist audience. For working purposes the
reader will generally be a computer scientist but not necessarily expert in cybersecurity or AI.
Thus, the student must describe suitably all aspects in the lifecycle of the project: background, through requirements, design,
implementation, evaluation and conclusions; </li>
<li>LO8 To present effectively work in progress and engage in constructive discussion about that work and its context. </li>

		  <th>Content</th><td> The content of the project is typically selected by the student from a range of topics proposed by the staff or industrial partners of the department.

            <ul>
              <li> Students use departmental and/or external facilities and are exposed to the state-of-the-art methods and concepts relevant to the project
topic. Students are expected to take responsibility for their own learning [LO1, LO2, LO3, LO4, LO5, LO6], and to plan and progress their
project in a professional and systematic way [LO2, LO3, LO4, LO5]. the progress made is reviewed at regular meetings with their
supervisor(s).
Project supervisions will encourage the student to consider how their work should be evaluated. Students will be encouraged to develop
evaluation criteria at an early stage but also as the work progresses. This may involve setting formal requirements and evaluating against
them. However, some post-hoc reflection is also to be encouraged, with students addressing for example, what they learned from the
project process [LO5. LO7, LO8].
Project supervisions will be used to engage students in the wider contextual issues [LO6].
Project work will be documented in a dissertation [LO7].
Students will receive feedback from supervisors on their immediate presentations, posters and dissertations, supporting the development of
varied communication skills. In addition, regular project dissertations with supervisors will develop oral communication skills [LO7, LO8].
