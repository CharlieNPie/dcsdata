          <td>In order to further develop the broad understanding of computational intelligence you will gain from the taught modules, this module will allow you to specialise in one or more aspects of the subject through an extended research project. You will undertake a detailed investigation into a topic in computational intelligence which will lead to more specialist knowledge and understanding in this specific area. You will also develop your project, research and communication skills. You will be expected to work largely independently but under the supervision of an academic member of staff.</td>

In addition, formative feedback will be provided to students based on an interim report. </td>

&bull; Demonstrate innovation and creativity within the context of an individual investigative project.<br>
&bull; Organise, structure and manage a substantial research project and independence in doing so.<br>
&bull; Distil and critically assess existing work in the form of a literature survey.<br>
&bull; Conduct appropriate theoretical, computational and/or experimental work as necessary for the specific project.<br>
